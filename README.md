# Space Invaders

This project is my own take on the classic Space Invaders game.

To play the game, run the main.py file.

The game is very simple. The player should press the right and left keys to, 
well, move the ship right or left, so as to dodge the incoming invaders.
The ship has three lives, visible at the top left corner, and it is defending 
an unseen base with also three lives, represented at the top right corner.

Unfortunately, the ship cannot shoot yet, so it's quite a challenge to survive
more than a few seconds, after which either the base or the player-controlled
space_ship will likely be destroyed. 

In the game over screen, the player can press either "R" to restart the game,
or "Q" to quit.
